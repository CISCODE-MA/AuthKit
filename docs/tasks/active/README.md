# Active Tasks - Auth Kit Module

Tasks currently in progress for the authentication module.

## Workflow

1. Create task file: `MODULE-XXX-description.md`
2. Update as you work
3. Move to `archive/by-release/vX.X.X/` on release

## Structure

Each task follows the template in main app but with MODULE- prefix.

## Breaking Changes

For module tasks, ALWAYS document:
- What changes in public API
- How apps need to update
- Migration guide if needed
